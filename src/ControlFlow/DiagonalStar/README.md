Diagonal Star
Write a method named printSquareStar with one parameter of type int named number.

If number is < 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".

The method should print diagonals to generate a rectangular pattern composed of stars (*). This should be accomplished by using loops (see examples below).

EXAMPLE 1
printSquareStar(5); should print the following:

<pre>
*****
** **
* * *
** **
*****
</pre>

EXAMPLE 2

printSquareStar(8); should print the following:

<pre>
********
**    **
* *  * *
*  **  *
*  **  *
* *  * *
**    **
********
</pre>
